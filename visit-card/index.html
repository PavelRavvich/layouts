                <h1>Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff</h1>
                <p>Born into a musical family, Rachmaninoff took up the piano at age four. </p>
                <p>He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1892 having already composed several piano and orchestral pieces. In 1897, following the negative critical reaction to his Symphony No. 1,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1901. For the next sixteen years, Rachmaninoff conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre, relocated
                    to Dresden, Germany, and toured the United States for the first time.

                <p>
                    Following the Russian Revolution, Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia; in 1918, they settled in the United States, first in New York City.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With his main source of income coming from piano and conducting performances, demanding tour schedules led to a reduction in his time for composition; between 1918 and 1943, he completed just six works, including Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Symphony
                    No. 3, and Symphonic Dances.
